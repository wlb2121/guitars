	<p>
		SideShow Guitars was started in 2015, when musician Wade Bounds
		decided to build his own instruments for his personal use. <br>
		After building his first Precision style bass and playing it live,
		Wade was approached to build instruments for other players. <br>
		Wade has built a few other instruments, mostly to give away to
		friends. He is now offering his instruments for sale.

	<h5>Here is a video with Wade playing his first creation, the
		green Precision bass.</h5>
